On June 7th an old co-worker reached out to me to share a "little moonlight project" that he thought might be of interest to me. He asked me to join a couple guys in starting a customer-focused offset program. They had already locked in an agency to do the initial design and build for the site, but was hoping I could provide ongoing engineering support.

I agreed and we had a couple conversations so that I could do some more research, but a week later he told me he decided to remove himself from the project due to a time commitment.

Three months went by and on September 18th, he reached out again letting me know he found a team and had the site built. Over the next month I met the other members of the team and learned a lot about carbon offsets and officially became a member of the founding team.

Now as "acting CTO" of a start up company I've been more motivated than ever to apply my engineering skills to a real project outside of my everyday job. Stay tuned for tutorials and lessons learned from the start up world.
