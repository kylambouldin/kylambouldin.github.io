title: "A Ruby on Rails project hosted on Heroku"
---

When I joined ActNeutral, they had already contracted out the website. It was hosted on Wordpress and used the WooCommerce plugin to handle membership subscriptions. I thought this would be great and that the website would practically run itself.All I would need to do is maintain a couple drag and drop pages. However, I should have expected that the other 3 members on the team would want very customized features.

As their ideas flooded in, I was tasked with learning that the backend of the site was very hard to follow. It was a couple years since I had developed my own Wordpress theme for another start up and PHP is definitely not my favorite language. I struggled for a couple weeks reading the code and trying to figure out how to implement what I could. The contracting company left messy code, no automated tests, no documentation, the files took at least 4 hours to download from their servers, and the code would not work on my local server.

I new now that I had to work on transferring the website off of Wordpress and onto something more scalable and sustainable. I chose to create a Ruby on Rails project and host it on Heroku. My main goals for the new website are to focus on accessibility, testing, documentation, and security. I also decided to start a blog so that I could keep notes on everything I learn and share this knowledge with others.

If you are interested in following along on my journey, then stay tuned! I'll be updating this main page with a table of contents to the posts related to this project.
