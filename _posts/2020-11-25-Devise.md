I want my new Ruby on Rails application to be able to handle users. These users should have the ability to sign up, login, stay logged in through sessions, logout, and get an email if they forget their password.

This post is going to use the [Devise gem](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) to handle all of this. Today I am going to walk through the setup process. In future articles I'll talk more about customizing the view.

## Add devise gem
Add this line to your Gemfile
```
gem 'devise'
```
then run
```
bundle install
```
## Install and Confingure Devise
Run this command in your terminal to create all the files that devise needs
```
rails g devise:install
```
Next, in your `config/environments/development.rb` file add the following line:
```
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
```
This allows the forgot my password email to be "sent" through your localhost. We will change this in the future for production capabilities

Next, add this code to your `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` right above your `yield` block.
```
<% if notice %>
  <p class="alert alert-success"><%= notice %></p>
<% end %>
<% if alert %>
  <p class="alert alert-danger"><%= alert %></p>
<% end %>
```
This allows us to see any success or error messages when signing up or logging in.

## Setup Devise Models
Devise automatically creates a `User` model for us. Run these commands in your terminal
```
rails g devise user
rails db:migrate
```

## Test!
Run your server and go to the sign in page on your localhost: (http://localhost:3000/users/sign_up)[http://localhost:3000/users/sign_up]. Try to create a new user and login! If everything is working, push the changes to your staging branch.
