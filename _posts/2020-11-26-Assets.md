I created the homepage and wanted to put a hero image behind some center text. It was working perfectly on my localhost, but once I pushed it up to the staging Heroku app, the image would not load.

My homepage.html.erb was:
```
<div class="container" id="homepage">
  <div class="hero">
    <h1>Get Rewarded<br/>for Going Carbon Neutral</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

and my homepage.scss was:
```
#homepage {
  .hero {
    background: linear-gradient(rgba(150,150,150,0.5),
	   rgba(150,150,150,0.5)),
	   url("/assets/pages/hiking-landscape-background.jpg");
    background-position: bottom;
    background-size: cover;
    height: 300px;

    ...
  }
}
```

All you need to do to get the assets to load on your staging and production servers is add the following code to the `config/environments/production.rb` file
```
config.assets.compile = true
config.public_file_server.enabled = true
```
Both your staging and production repositories have the RAILS_ENV="production". If you have a separate staging environment, add the lines to the staging.rb file as well.
