Today I am going to walk you through the setup process to get a "production" and staging Ruby on Rails application hosted on a hobby-tier Heroku account. I put production in quotes because the site I am working on will not be connected to an external domain name or database (yet). The main code will be stored on Github with automatic deploys on Heroku. Hopefully in articles to come I will set up testing and CI/CD. Well, lets get started!

## Ruby on Rails Setup
1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Restart your terminal after the installation.

2. Install [Ruby Version Manager (RVM)](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/)
```
$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

3. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
```
$ rvm install 2.5.7
$ rvm --default use 2.5.7
```

4. Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
```
$ gem install bundler
```

5. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
The `make install` command takes about 20-25 minutes, so be patient
```
$ brew install postgresql
```
Start PostgreSQL
```
brew services start postgresql
```

6. Create a new rails Project
```
rails new rails-website
cd rails-website
bundle install
rails s
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to make sure your new app works on localhost! Next we set up our Github repository.

## Github Setup
1. Set up a [new Github account](https://github.com/join) or make sure you can login to your existing one

2. Create a new Github repository

3. Push your new rails project to your repository
Initialize your project directory as a Git repository, add and commit files
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
```
Find the https url used to clone the repository, set up the remote repository, change your branch to main, and push the changes to Github
```
git branch main
git checkout main
git remote add origin <https-url>
git push -u origin main
```

Hurray! Now your code is on github. The next step is to make your code compatible with Heroku.

## Heroku Setup
1. Checkout a new `staging` branch
2. Add a `Procfile` to your repository and add the following information. This is what tells Heroku how to start your application.
  ```
  web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
  ```
3. In your Gemfile, replace `gem 'sqlite3'` with `gem 'pg'`. Then run `bundle install`
4. Update your `config/database.yml` to
    ```
    default: &default
      adapter: postgresql
      encoding: unicode
      pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
      timeout: 5000

    development:
      <<: *default
      database: rails_development

    test:
      <<: *default
      database: rails_test

    production:
      <<: *default
      database: rails_production
    ```
5. Update your `config/puma.rb` file to:
    ```
    workers Integer(ENV['WEB_CONCURRENCY'] || 2)
    threads_count = Integer(ENV['RAILS_MAX_THREADS'] || 5)
    threads threads_count, threads_count

    preload_app!

    rackup      DefaultRackup
    port        ENV['PORT']     || 3000
    environment ENV['RACK_ENV'] || 'development'

    on_worker_boot do
      ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
    end
    ```
6. Run `rails s` and go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to make sure nothing broke.
7. Push the code to your staging branch.

Now we set up heroku and see how you can use the staging and main branches to test code

## Heroku Setup
1. Create a new Heroku pipeline
Create a new pipeline on Heroku and connect it the new repository you created.
2. Add a new app under the staging section and a new app under the production section.
3. In the deploy section for your staging app, connect the app to your `staging` branch. Click `Deploy Branch` to deploy the code that is currently on the branch. You can enable automatic deploys so in the future new code is deployed when it is pushed to the branch.
4. Do the same thing for your production app except do not push the code yet. Just enable automatic deploys from the `main` branch.
6. Open up your staging app and you should expect to see this on the page. This is because we have not set up any routes on the server.

7. On github, create a pull request and merge your staging branch into your main branch. Your production heroku app should deploy the new code automatically.

Thats it! Thanks for following along. Now you have a fully functioning branch new rails application to play around with AND when you deploy code to your staging and main branches, they code will automatically deploy to Heroku where they are on fully hosted environments and can be shared with others.

Next I'll go through adding Devise to the application, setting up a homepage, login page, and a dashboard page.
