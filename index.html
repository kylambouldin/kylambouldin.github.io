<h1 id="main-title">Hello World! I'm Kyla Bouldin</h1>
<p>
  I've been programming for fun since 2009 and professionally since 2016.
  I'm a full stack engineer and enjoy developing user experience focused views, working with RESTful APIs, and architechting database models and relationships.

    I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at BARK where I work with Ruby on Rails, VueJS, and PostgreSQL on the Subscription Management team.
    Our team is responsible for creating new features to help customers and internal customer service agents manage subscription and account details.

    In October 2020, I helped start a consumer focused carbon-offset company called ActNeutral.
    Our goal is to build a community that allows individuals to offset their carbon emissions and get rewarded by brands that support our mission.

  Exercising consistently is hard but I do enjoy working out when I can get myself to do it!
  When the weather is nice, I try to run with my dog in the morning. She is an Australian Shepherd Mix so she loves to run and hike.
  I've also found that, similar to running, practicing yoga is a form of meditation that helps me relax.
